# Planning Poker bot

Instead of paying attention, you can just post random estimates. Will anybody even notice? Or are you a fan of #NoEstimates? Or you are a remote and you have a super boring planning session on Slack, while at the same time there's a new GoT episode on the torrents ready to watch?

  **I am ready. Take me to the [Planning Poker Bot](https://zdanowicz.dev/planning-poker-bot/index.html)!**
## Challenge

Post only messages from the planning poker bot on the whole planning session (estimation part at least). Send me screenshots and after the community verification you'll be granted a special entry in the *h*all of fame*

Please do not make this project super popular so your team doesn't notice.


## Contribution

I'd love to see your contribution! Can we pass a Turing test?


## Hall of Fame
List of all developers that manage to survive the whole planning session unnoticed by posting random estimates. Score formula is measured as follows:

``` score = count_of_estimates_posted/smartness_level ``` 

Which is: the more answers you give and the less "smart" you are, the higher score you get. Which means - the better you are. Or the worse your team is.
